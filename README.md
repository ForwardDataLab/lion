# Listen Online

Listen Online is a querying mediator for web services that do not provide a machine-readable description of their capabilties. This is done through GraphQL wrappers around various different data sources like Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube. The user builds a GraphQL query via an interactive tree building front-end component. The canonical example of a user this application is someone who is interested in the vast amount of data available on the Internet, but don't know how to program. For instance, a public health researcher might be interested in extracting data from Tweets to learn about any trends or new serious diseases. Queries can also be ran on a set schedule( i.e. every day, every month, etc). Users can collect data over a long period of time. Listen Online provides an easy way to listen to the social universe for more people, which was not the case before as only programmers know how to work with APIs.
